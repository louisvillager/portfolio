## Code Louisville @ Bellarmine Front End Summer 2019 Portfolio

This is an in-class project as part of the Code Louisville Front End
Web Development class.  It covers basic HTML and CSS, including
some elements of responsive design.

There are three pages within this project:
- Portfolio
- About
- Contact

---

**Portfolio**

A simple index page with images and text boxes.

**About**

A page with a general personal description and photo.  The
Twitter handle is fake, and was only used for class purposes.

**Contact**

A page for contact information and a common layout for it.
The phone number and Twitter handle are fake, but the email
address is functional.
